with [Inspectr](https://github.com/inspectr-hq/inspectr) and inspect all the details in the Inspectr viewer.

### Public Exposure of Local Services

When developing locally, you often need to test integrations or share your local environment with external systems or team members. Inspectr Ingress provides a secure, easy-to-use solution for publicly exposing your local service without complicated setup or firewall adjustments.

- **Secure Public Access** ‚Äì Create a secure public endpoint linked directly to your local development server.

- **Custom Subdomains** ‚Äì Choose a unique, custom subdomain to clearly identify and easily share your endpoint.

- **Real-time Request Capture** ‚Äì Monitor requests hitting your local service instantly in both the Inspectr UI and console.

- **AI services** ‚Äì Seamlessly expose local AI, LLM models or MCP servers, enabling easy integration collaboration, or demonstrations from your laptop

- **Collaboration-Friendly** ‚Äì Quickly share your endpoint with colleagues, stakeholders, or external systems to streamline feedback and testing cycles.

Check out the [Inspectr documentation](https://github.com/inspectr-hq/inspectr?tab=readme-ov-file#exposing-local-services-publicly) to learn how simple it is to securely expose your local environment to the world.

### Webhook Capturing Service

When building applications that rely on webhooks or external callbacks, manually re-triggering a webhook can be a hassle - especially when dealing with third-party systems. With Inspectr, you can capture incoming webhook events automatically and replay requests when needed, eliminating the need for repeated triggering the events.

- **Expose** your local webhook endpoints to receive events from remote systems.
- **Catch** incoming webhook events without requiring a live backend.
- **Replay** captured webhook requests on demand for efficient debugging and testing.
- **Streamline** third-party integration debugging with real-time event insights.

Read the "[Inspecting Webhook Events](https://github.com/inspectr-hq/inspectr?tab=readme-ov-file#inspecting-webhook-events)"
article which explains how to use the [Inspectr](https://github.com/inspectr-hq/inspectr) to create a public webhook endpoint that catches all webhook events.

### Easy Front-end Request Inspection

For front-end applications, you can simply replace your API endpoint URL with the Inspectr Proxy URL. This enables you
to inspect & collect outgoing requests and their responses without any additional backend configuration. Combine the
Proxy with your existing front-end workflow for a transparent debugging experience.

- **Zero-config Integration** - Plug Inspectr into your front-end with only a base URL change. Works with any framework or HTTP client.
- **Transparent Debugging** - View outgoing requests and responses without modifying the backend.
- **Request History** ‚Äì Easily track, search & filter past requests for analysis.

Have a look at the [Inspectr](https://github.com/inspectr-hq/inspectr?tab=readme-ov-file#inspecting-front-end-api-requests) documentation to see how easy it is to use
it in your front-end application.

### Mock & Override responses

Inspectr Proxy includes a powerful mock mode and response override controls, allowing you to simulate backend behavior using an OpenAPI specification. This is especially useful for:

- **API Development**: Test your frontend against a mock API before the real backend is ready
- **API Testing**: Simulate various response scenarios to validate client behavior
- **Demos and Presentations**: Create reliable demos without depending on external services
- **Offline Development**: Work on your application without needing access to the actual backend

# Components

Inspectr provides multiple components, that can be used in different ways, depending on your use case:

## üîå Request capturing

### üîπ Proxy Inspectr

Run **Inspectr** locally as an **HTTP API proxy** to intercept and log traffic between your frontend and backend services. Great for local debugging and development.

### üîπ Ingress Inspectr

**Expose** your **local API** or **AI service** securely to external systems through the hosted **Ingress Inspectr** service, enabling real-world integrations and testing without complex network configurations.

Your local running service can be exposed to the public internet via a private endpoint, without the need to deploy your service externally. The ingress is a pure forwarding service that delivers the remote requests to your local Inspectr setup.

## üîç Request inspections

### üîπ Standalone App

Run **Inspectr** as an standalone application that can be deployed in various environments:

- **Localhost** ‚Äì Self-hosted for debugging API requests or webhook events directly on your machine. Comes with the Proxy Inspectr.
- **Vercel** ‚Äì Cloud-hosted for easy access and seamless integration.

More info can be found in the [Inspectr App](https://github.com/inspectr-hq/inspectr-app) repository.

# Exposing Inspectr publicly with Inspect Ingress

> Inspectr Ingress is a public ingress service, that lets you easily share local web services publicly. It assigns a unique
> URL (like [https://your-channel-abc.in-spectr.dev](https://your-channel-abc.in-spectr.dev)) that forwards requests to your locally running server (
> e.g., [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)), bypassing DNS and firewall hassles.

## Configuration

If you start your local Inspectr with `--expose`, your local service will be exposed publicly. 
Optionally, use `--channel` to request your preferred subdomain, if you have not preferred `--channel`, a random channel will be selected. A security code to protect your channel & subdomain will be generated or it can be set to your preference, using the `channel-code` parameter.

> [!NOTE]
> Inspectr will use the `channel` to create subdomains on `in-spectr.dev` (notice the -)

For example:

```bash
./inspectr --listen=":8080" --backend="http://localhost:3000" --expose --channel="your-channel-abc"
```

or by executing `./inspectr` with the configuration set in `.inspectr.yaml` file

```yaml
listen: ":8080"
backend: "http://localhost:3000"
expose: true
channel: "your-channel-abc"
```

Your service is now available on [https://your-channel-abc.in-spectr.dev](https://your-channel-abc.in-spectr.dev)

```bash
curl https://your-channel-abc.in-spectr.dev
```

and locally on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```

This will:

- Expose the proxy publicly via Inspectr Ingress (attempting to use the subdomain `your-channel-abc` on `https://in-spectr.dev`), forwarding requests to the
  local Inspectr on `8080`.
- The local Inspectr listens on port `8080` forward local and remote requests to the backend at [http://localhost:30000](http://localhost:30000).
- Print the received requests in the terminal
- Show the captured data real-time in Inspectr App in your browser

## How It Works

1. Proxy Mode:
   
   Your local proxy Inspectr instance listens on the specified `--listen` address. If a backend is defined via `--backend`, it forwards the
   incoming HTTP request to that backend and relays the response back to the client. If `--ingress` is enabled, the proxy Inspectr is exposed publicly via the Inspectr Ingress service.

2. Data Capture & Wrapping:
   
   All request and response details are captured into an Inspectr Operation data structure. This data is then wrapped in a
   CloudEvents envelope.

3. Embedded Inspectr App:
   
   The embedded Inspectr App server runs on the port specified by `--app-port` and serves the Inspectr UI for real‚Äëtime
   updates.

4. Broadcasting & Logging:
   
      - If the `--print` flag is enabled, a color‚Äëcoded summary of each transaction is printed to the console.
      - If the embedded app mode is enabled (`--app`), the data is also broadcast internally via SSE.

---

# Usage

Inspectr is easy to use and offers a number of configuration options, depending on your usage.
Below are some practical examples.

### Inspecting API HTTP Traffic

Suppose you have a backend service running on port
`3000`. You want to inspect all HTTP request and responses sent to the backend service, log the details to the console, and view the request and response data in real time via the Inspectr UI.

You would start your Inspectr as follows:

```bash
./inspectr --listen=":8080" --backend="http://localhost:3000"
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inspectr-hq/inspectr/main/assets/inspectr-app.png" alt="Request Inspectr" width="80%">

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inspectr-hq/inspectr/main/assets/inspectr-console.png" alt="Console Inspectr" width="80%">

**Explanation:**

- The proxy listens on port `8080` and forwards requests to the backend at "http://localhost:3000.
- Captured request and response data are printed to the console.
- Captured data is also sent to the Inspectr UI service at default port `4004`. Visit http://localhost:4004 to view the Inspectr UI.

### Inspecting Webhook Events

In this case, you want to inspect webhook events sent from a third-party service. You may not have a backend service to forward the requests to‚Äîinstead you simply want to capture and inspect the incoming webhook payloads. You can start Inspectr without a backend so that every incoming request receives a default 200 OK response while still capturing and broadcasting the webhook data:

```bash
./inspectr --listen=":8080" --catch=true --expose=true
```

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inspectr-hq/inspectr/main/assets/inspectr-webhook.png" alt="Request Inspectr" width="80%">

**Explanation:**

- Via the remote Ingress Inspectr, a public URL is linked to the local Inspectr to be able to receive remote webhook events.
- The local Inspectr, which is connected, immediately returns a 200 OK response for every incoming webhook event.
- The webhook event payload details are captured and printed to the console.
- The captured webhook event is sent to the Inspectr App. Visit http://localhost:40004 to see the webhook events in real time.

### Inspecting Front-End API Requests

For front-end applications, you can simply replace your API endpoint URL with the Inspectr URL. All received request on Inspectr, will be forwarded to the API backend service, while this enables you to inspect and collect outgoing requests and their responses without any additional backend configuration. 
By using Inspectr, you gain visibility into how your front-end interacts with APIs, making debugging easier without modifying the client-side code.

**Example: Using Inspectr Proxy in a Front-End App**

If your application makes requests to an API at:

```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/data", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer token",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
});
```

You can modify the endpoint to route through Inspectr:

```js
fetch("http://localhost:8080/data", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer token",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
});
```

Configure Inspectr to forward requests to the API endpoints:

```bash
./inspectr --listen=":8080" --backend="https://api.example.com"
```

**Explanation:**

- The front-end makes requests to http://localhost:8080 instead of the original API.

- Inspectr forwards requests to https://api.example.com and relays the responses.

- All captured requests and responses are logged in the Inspectr App (http://localhost:4004).

- If needed, you can enable "expose" to make the API endpoints publicly available

```bash
./inspectr --listen=":8080" --backend="https://api.example.com"  --expose=true
```

This approach seamlessly integrates Inspectr into your front-end workflow, allowing you to monitor API interactions in real-time without modifying the backend.

### Mocking API Responses with Inspectr

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This feature is early-stage and considered **beta**.

Inspectr supports **mock mode**, allowing you to simulate API backend responses based on an OpenAPI specification. This is particularly useful during front-end development, testing, or when your actual backend is unavailable or incomplete.

By enabling mock mode, Inspectr returns realistic, static responses as defined in your OpenAPI specification without the need of developing the actual service.

> [!NOTE]  
> Inspectr is using the powerfull [Prism](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism) package from [StopLight](https://stoplight.io/open-source/prism)

Launch Inspectr in static mock mode with your OpenAPI specification:

```bash
./inspectr --listen=":8080" --mock-backend="./openapi.yaml"
```

[//]: # (If you are looking for more advanced API mocking solutions, have a look at [Prism]&#40;https://stoplight.io/open-source/prism&#41;, [MockerServer.og]&#40;https://www.mocks-server.org/&#41; or [Microcks]&#40;https://microcks.io/&#41;)

### **Explanation:**

- Inspectr matches incoming requests against your OpenAPI specification (`openapi.yaml`) and provides mock responses based on the example(s) in OpenAPI.

- If Inspectr cannot match a request with the specification, it returns a default `200 OK` response with an empty body.

- All incoming requests and mock responses are logged and visible in the Inspectr App (`http://localhost:4004`).

If needed, you can also combine mock mode with exposing the mocked API publicly:

```
./inspectr --listen=":8080" --mock-backend="./openapi.yaml" --expose=true
```

### Overriding API Responses

Inspectr supports **response overrides**, allowing you to control how requests are responded during **mock** or **catch** mode using custom headers. This is useful for testing client behavior against simulated scenarios like timeouts, error responses, or simulating non-expected status codes.

By adding special `inspectr-` headers to your request, you can manipulate how Inspectr responds‚Äîregardless of what‚Äôs defined in the OpenAPI spec or what the backend returns.

Here‚Äôs how you can use these headers:

| Header                           | Description                                                                | Supported modes                |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |--------------------------------|
| `inspectr-response-delay`        | Introduce artificial delay in milliseconds (e.g. `2000`)                   | - catch<br/>- mock<br/>- proxy |
| `inspectr-response-status`       | Override the HTTP status code (e.g. `503`, `404`)                          | - catch<br/>- mock             |
| `inspectr-response-content-type` | Set a custom `Content-Type` (e.g. `application/xml`)                       | - catch<br/>- mock             |
| `inspectr-response-example`      | Force a specific OpenAPI response example to be used (e.g. `errorExample`) | - mock                         |

#### **Example usage :**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/items \   
-H "inspectr-response-status: 503" \   
-H "inspectr-response-delay: 2000" \   
-H "inspectr-response-content-type: application/json" \   
-H "inspectr-response-example: errorExample"
```

### **Explanation:**

- These headers let you simulate slow networks, unexpected status codes, or non-default examples.

- In **mock mode**, the override headers modify the mock response generated from the OpenAPI spec.

- In **catch mode**, the override headers modify response returned from the generic catch response.

- All overridden responses are logged and shown in the Inspectr App (`http://localhost:4004`).

> [!TIP]  
> Combine mock and override to simulate full API behavior ‚Äî including edge cases ‚Äî without writing any backend logic.

### Exposing Your Ollama API via Inspectr

When developing and experimenting with local AI services like [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), you often need a quick way to expose your local model to external services, integrations, or collaborators. Inspectr simplifies this task, securely forwarding requests to your Ollama API without complicated network configurations or firewall changes.

**Start Your Ollama Server**

Ensure your Ollama service is running locally. By default, Ollama runs on port `11434`:

```bash
ollama serve
```

**Run Inspectr to Expose Ollama**

Execute Inspectr to securely expose your Ollama API externally:

```bash
inspectr --listen=":8080" --backend="http://localhost:11434" --expose --channel="my-ollama-api"
```

Your Ollama API is now publicly available at:

```bash
https://my-ollama-api.in-spectr.dev
```

**Accessing the API Remotely**

Now external services or team members can interact directly with your Ollama API remotely:

```bash
curl https://my-ollama-api.in-spectr.dev/api/generate -d '{"model": "llama2", "prompt": "Hello, world!"}'
```

**Explanation:**

- `--listen=":8080"`: Sets Inspectr to listen on port `8080` locally.

- `--backend="http://localhost:11434"`: Points Inspectr to your running Ollama API (default port is `11434`).

- `--expose`: Activates public exposure of your Inspectr service via Inspectr Ingress.

- `--channel="my-ollama-api"`: Defines a custom, easy-to-share subdomain.

As soon as you stop your local Inspectr instance, your channel/subdomain and connection will be removed.

## YAML Configuration File (.inspectr.yaml) Options

In addition to command-line flags, you can configure Inspectr using a YAML file. 

Create a file named `.inspectr.yaml` in your working directory or pass its path using the `--config` flag. The parameters in the YAML file correspond to the  
command-line flags. Note: Any parameter provided via the command line will override the corresponding value in the YAML  
file.
